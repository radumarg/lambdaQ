<p style="font-size: 26px;  max-width: 1450px; margin-left: 30px;">

A functional quantum programming language whose starting point is the quantum lambda calculus created by Peter Selinger 
and Benoit Valiron: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0404056">A lambda calculus for quantum computation with classical control</a>.

<br/>
<br/>


Rather than being another theoretical language designed for the study of the mathematics of quantum programming, 
lambdaQ is meant to be a practical language that will be eventually compiled to OpenQASM3 and later to 
LLVM Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) in order to be executed on real quantum devices. This is an ongoing project, 
very much in the early stages of implementation. More details regarding the plans that are currently being made for development, 
can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/radumarg/lambdaQ/blob/main/doc/development-plan.md">development-plan.md </a>.

A functional quantum programming language whose starting point is quantum lambda calculus developed by Peter Selinger and Benoit Valiron:

Rather than being another theoretical language designed for the study of the mathematics of quantum computation, lambdaQ is meant to be a practical language that will be eventually compiled to LLVM Quantum Intermediate Representation (QIR) and IBMQ OpenQASM3 in order to be executed on real quantum devices. This is an ongoing project, very much in the early stages of implementation. More details regarding the plans that are currently being made for the project, can be found in [doc/development-plan.md] (https://github.com/radumarg/lambdaQ/blob/main/doc/development-plan.md).
